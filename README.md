# Outpost
8:57 PM - 13 descending eyeliners: Sup! How can I help? :)
8:57 PM - Toughsox: hi there. I commented on one of your Outpost trades, if you havent noticed yet.
8:57 PM - 13 descending eyeliners: Ah yeah, you interested in the DC?
8:57 PM - 13 descending eyeliners has changed their name to Hugges.
8:58 PM - Toughsox: Not at all.....I commented so you would see the icon next to my name, which identifies me as a Moderator on Outpost.
8:58 PM - Toughsox: I added you due to a report made against you which Id like to discuss
8:58 PM - Hugges: A report?
8:58 PM - Toughsox: aye
8:58 PM - Hugges: Never noticed one. On steamrep?
8:58 PM - Toughsox: the 2 hearts bombers you had, whom did you trade those to and can you tell me when please
8:59 PM - Toughsox: no, on Outpost you were reported
8:59 PM - Hugges: Sure. Sold them to one guy at different times.
8:59 PM - Toughsox: can you tell me to whom and when please, as it is showing the person being marked on SteamRep as a scammer
9:00 PM - Hugges: Ah yeah. Was wondering if someone was going to call me out on that. I've been freinds with the dude for a while now. His name is Lemonade
9:01 PM - Hugges: Looks like he unknowingly traded with scammers a few times, and was punished for it
9:01 PM - Toughsox: that would be the person that is marked.....do you remember when you made the last trade then?
9:01 PM - Hugges: I'll check
9:01 PM - Toughsox: thank you
9:02 PM - Hugges: Why exactly is this an issue though? Am I potentially being banned for trading with this guy or something?
9:02 PM - Toughsox: depending on when you traded with him, yes
9:03 PM - Hugges: That so
9:03 PM - Toughsox: you are not allowed to trade with marked scammers, regardless of the reason. marked means marked
9:03 PM - Toughsox: if you did when he was marked, then it would be a 2 week ban from Outpost for that
9:04 PM - Hugges: That's unfortunate
9:04 PM - Toughsox: perhaps, but its our rules, and the rules of the entire trading community. As you already noted, he is marked for, trading with marked people
9:04 PM - Toughsox: thus, trading with marked people can and does get others marked as well
9:05 PM - Hugges: That's interesting. Never knew someone cared so much about what I do privately
9:06 PM - Toughsox: it isnt privately when you are using public sites to advertise your trades
9:06 PM - Hugges: Like I said, we've been friends for a long time. Even before I publicly advertised my bombers
9:07 PM - Toughsox: when you 1st joined Outpost, you had to agree to our rules. Nothing has changed in the terms of trading with marked people.
9:07 PM - Toughsox: while I can appreciate your friendship with this person, you arent allowed to trade with him for items of value.
9:08 PM - Hugges: I made the trade so that I could finally potentially cash out. I noticed he had the gibus and offered it to him myself. nothing was done through outpost
9:08 PM - Toughsox: you and I can debate this all we want, the matter is still, did you trade with him while he was marked. How, or where you traded is not the issue here
9:13 PM - Hugges: Look man. Yes, I traded it to him right when I noticed he became marked, about 5 days ago. Thing is, I just want to cash out (as I did with the pure I got from selling the first bomber), partly because of what the trading community has become, with this conversation being a part of that. Now I understand you're just doing your job. But i seriously don't need this right now. I'm in dire need of the money since I'm going to be going into college shortly. This would severely hurt my chances of that
9:14 PM - Toughsox: he was actually marked amost 3 weeks ago
9:15 PM - Hugges: I get that, but why would i need to keep track of those things.
9:15 PM - Toughsox: and put yourself in my shoes, everyone that I add has some sort of story, which I like to give the benefit of the dount to, but Im not permitted to make exceptions since we have no way to know who is telling the truth and who isnt.
9:16 PM - Toughsox: because whom you trade with is your responsibility at all times, thats why
9:16 PM - Toughsox: while I can sympathize with your story, you would have to explain that if you are going to appeal. Our Appeals Admins respond to appeals quite quickly.
9:17 PM - Hugges: And you know what's better for me that I do, am i getting that right?
9:17 PM - Hugges: than*
9:18 PM - Toughsox: I have no idea whats better for you to be perfectly honest.
9:18 PM - Hugges: Yes you are
9:18 PM - Hugges: That's precisely what you just told me is the reason you're banning me
9:19 PM - Hugges: That i should "know better"
9:19 PM - Toughsox: you are being banned for trading with a marked scammer, plain and simple.
9:19 PM - Toughsox: how you want to go forward after this is your own choice. If you wish to continue trading with your friend, or others like him, thats your perrogative.
9:20 PM - Toughsox: as I said, you and I can debate this all we want, it wont change the fact of what you did versus what I have to do as a result of that
9:21 PM - Toughsox: you have been trading on Outpost for almost 2 years. Id have a hard time knowing that you didnt know that this was a rule
9:22 PM - Hugges: I was not aware ONE trade can get you banned, no
9:22 PM - Hugges: Since every time I see a ban for trading with marked users, it says precisely that. "This user was banned for trading with marked userS" or something of the sort
9:23 PM - Toughsox: thats correct...... and this incident is no different
9:24 PM - Toughsox: so, you are admitting that you are aware we ban for this....so this should not be any sort of a shock to you.
9:24 PM - Hugges: I traded one person, not multiple. Im not out to get the better side of a deal
9:25 PM - Toughsox: alot of times, the other people are banned for the same exact reason. They got a reasonable deal, or they simply liked the item they got.....not to make some sort of profit.  It doesnt change the fact that rules were broken.
9:25 PM - Hugges: Then the entire rule broken. How do you not see that. I
9:26 PM - Hugges: I'm aware people get warning bans for trading with multiple scammers/marked users. Didn't know one trade can trigger that
9:26 PM - Toughsox: usually, its always just for 1 trade
9:27 PM - Toughsox: the ones involving multiple trades are typically those that do not care and do it again and wind up permanently banned and/or marked shortly there after.
9:28 PM - Hugges: But I don't really have time for this, nor do i have time for trading. I have to pack for this trip I'm going on tommorrow. Do what you will, but it doesn't change the fact that this ban would do nothing but hurt my chances at being finantially stable
9:29 PM - Toughsox: I do thank you for your time and honesty in this matter and wish you the best on your trip.
9:30 PM - Toughsox is now Offline.
